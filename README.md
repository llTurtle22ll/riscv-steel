## Available RISC-V IP

 [**RISC-V Steel System-on-Chip**](https://riscv-steel.github.io/riscv-steel/soc/)

System-on-chip design with RISC-V Steel Processor Core, memory and UART module.

[**RISC-V Steel Processor Core**](https://riscv-steel.github.io/riscv-steel/core/)

32-bit processor core design implementing the RV32I ISA, the Zicsr extension and the Machine-mode privileged architecture of RISC-V.

## Get Started!

The [Getting Started Guide](https://riscv-steel.github.io/riscv-steel/getting-started/) shows you how to synthesize the [Hello World](https://github.com/riscv-steel/riscv-steel/tree/main/hello-world) demo for some popular FPGA boards. The demo is an instance of RISC-V Steel SoC that sends a Hello World message to a host computer via UART protocol. Its goal is to introduce you to the SoC design so that you can expand it and run your own software.
