# RISC-V Steel Processor Core IP</br><small>Documentation</small>

## Introduction

RISC-V Steel Processor Core is a 32-bit processor core IP implementing the RV32I instruction set, the Zicsr extension and the Machine-mode privileged architecture of RISC-V.

RISC-V Steel Processor Core is a single-issue, in-order, unpipelined processor core.

RISC-V Steel Processor Core can run real-time operating systems and bare-metal embedded software. It is designed to work as a processing unit in a wide variety of embedded applications.

## Memory operations

This section explains how read and write operations requested by RISC-V Steel Processor Core work and the expected response to these requests.

???+ info

    The processor core never requests to read and write in the same clock cycle. The processor core is either reading from memory or writing to it.

### Read request

The processor core drives the memory signals as follows in a read request:

- the address is placed in the **mem_address** bus.

- the **mem_read_request** signal is driven to logic `HIGH`.

- **mem_address** and **mem_read_request** hold their values until **mem_read_request_ack** is driven to logic `HIGH` by the memory device.

The response to a read request from the memory device must observe these rules:

- The read data must be placed in the **mem_read_data** bus.

- the **mem_read_request_ack** signal must never be driven to logic `HIGH` before **mem_read_data** holds valid data. It must be held `HIGH` for only one clock cycle per request.

- A response must never be given in the same clock cycle that **mem_read_request** was driven `HIGH`.

The timing diagram below contains examples of valid read operations:

### Write request

The processor core drives the memory signals as follows in a write request:

- the address is placed in the **mem_address** bus.

- the **mem_write_request** signal is driven to logic `HIGH`.

- the data to be written is placed in the **mem_write_data** bus.

- the **mem_write_strobe** signal will indicate which byte lanes of **mem_write_data** must be written.

    For example, if this signal holds `4'b0001`, then only the least significant byte must be written. The upper 24 bits of **mem_write_data** must be ignored.

- all signals above hold their values until **mem_write_request_ack** is driven to logic `HIGH` by the memory device.

The response to a write request from the memory device must observe these rules:

- the **mem_write_request_ack** signal must be driven to logic `HIGH` only if the write operation succeeded. It must be held `HIGH` for only one clock cycle per request.

- A response must never be given in the same clock cycle that **mem_write_request** was driven `HIGH`.

The timing diagram below contains examples of valid write operations:

## Interrupt requests

There are three interrupt types in the RISC-V architecture: external, timer, and software. RISC-V Steel Processor Core provides dedicated signals (**irq_external**, **irq_timer** and **irq_software**) to request each of these interrupt types.

A device can request an interrupt by driving the **irq_\*** signal to logic `HIGH` and holding it `HIGH` until the request is accepted. The processor accepts the request by driving the **irq_\*_ack** signal to logic `HIGH` for one clock cycle. The requesting device can drive the **irq_\*** signal to logic `LOW` in the next clock cycle after the acknowledgement, or keep it `HIGH` to make a new request.

The timing diagram below is an example of a valid interrupt request:

<figure markdown>
  ![](images/irq.svg)
  <figcaption><strong>Figure 3</strong> - Interrupt request timing diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

An interrupt request is accepted if:

- the global interrupt enable bit is set (field **mie** in the **mstatus** CSR), and

- the corresponding interrupt type is enabled (fields **meie**, **mtie** and **msie** in the **mie** CSR).

The processor proceeds as follows when an interrupt request is accepted:

- the execution of the current instruction is aborted.

- the memory address of the aborted instruction is saved in the **mepc** CSR.

- the program counter is set to the value of the **mtvec** CSR.

- the **mcause** CSR is set to a value encoding the type of the interrupt.

- the global interrupt enable bit **mstatus.mie** is set to logic `LOW`, disabling new interrupts.

- the prior interrupt enable bit **mstatus.mpie** is set to logic `HIGH`.

- the corresponding ack signal (**irq_\*_ack**) is set to logic `HIGH` for one clock cycle.

The **mtvec** CSR is set by software to the address of an interrupt handler routine, so the core branches from normal execution and starts the execution of the interrupt handler.

The **mret** instruction is used by software to return from the interrupt handler. When this instruction is executed the core proceeds as follows:

- the program counter is set to the value of the **mepc** CSR.

- the global interrupt enable bit **mstatus.mie** receives the value saved in the **mstatus.mpie** bit.

- the prior interrupt enable bit **mstatus.mpie** is set to logic `LOW`. 

The value in the **mepc** register is the address of the instruction aborted by the interrupt, so normal execution is resumed.

## Real time clock

RISC-V Steel Processor Core provides a 64-bit bus to update the **utime** CSR with the value measured from a real time clock. The value of **utime** is updated on every rising edge of the **clock** signal and can be read with the **csrr** instruction.

???+ info

    Although the cycle counter register **mcycle** can be used to measure time lapses, it cannot provide wall clock time. And it can only realiably measure time lapses if the **clock** signal is connected to a stable oscillating signal, which is not always the case.
